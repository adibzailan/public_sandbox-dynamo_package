# Rooms to Ceilings
> Last Updated: 1 January 2025
> Version: 3.0.0
> Category: Rooms to Elements Processing

## Overview
Creates ceiling elements from room boundaries with configurable height offset.

## Purpose
The Rooms to Ceilings node automates the creation of ceiling elements based on room boundaries in Revit. It streamlines the process of generating accurate ceiling geometry while providing control over height offsets and maintaining model integrity.

## Inputs
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `Rooms` | List<Room> | Yes | List of rooms to process | - |
| `CeilingType` | CeilingType | Yes | Ceiling type for creation | - |
| `Level` | Level | Yes | Level for ceiling placement | - |
| `Offset` | double | No | Height offset in millimeters | 2700 |

## Outputs
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `created_ceilings` | List<ElementId> | List of created ceiling ElementIds |
| `failed_rooms` | List<Room> | List of rooms that failed processing |
| `debug_info` | List<string> | List of critical messages |
| `preview` | string | Status messages for Dynamo UI |

## Usage Notes
- Ensure rooms have valid boundaries before processing
- Validates room geometry before ceiling creation
- Supports batch processing of multiple rooms
- Provides detailed feedback for failed operations

## Example Usage
```python
# Example Dynamo workflow
1. Select rooms using Room.ByName or similar
2. Select ceiling type using CeilingType.ByName
3. Select level using Level.ByName
4. Optionally set height offset (default: 2700mm)
5. Optionally specify a log file path
6. Run to create ceilings from room boundaries
```

## Error Handling
- Validates room boundaries before processing
- Maintains transaction integrity with rollback on failure
- Detailed logging of failed operations with reasons
- Skips invalid rooms while continuing processing

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized for batch processing of multiple rooms
- Efficient boundary extraction using Revit API
- Smart transaction management for better performance
- Minimal memory footprint during processing

## Limitations
- Only processes rooms with valid boundaries
- Cannot handle overlapping room boundaries
- Requires appropriate Revit permissions
- Some complex room geometries may need manual verification

## Version History
